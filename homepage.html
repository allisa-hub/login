  <h3 style="margin-top:50px;">PROFILE</h3>
  
   <p style="displayCflex;">Carigara is a 2nd class municipality in the province of Leyte. It has 49 barangays, 5 of which are in the poblacion, (Baybay, Ponong, Sawang, San Mateo and Jugaban). Established in 1571, Carigara holds the distinction of being the inaugural town founded in the expansive Eastern Visayas region. The Poblacion is located 54 kilometers away from Tacloban City, the capital of Leyte and regional center of Region VIII or Eastern Visayas. It could be reached by sea and land transportation.         
</p>

  <h3>BRIEF HISTORY</h3>
  
   <p style=" display:flex;">According to local legend, the town got its name from the original settler, the founder of the town, Datu Gara. People referred to the place as Kan Gara, meaning “that of Gara” or simply “Gara’s”. The historian, Jaime de Veyra, in his book Tandaya or Candaya says, that Carigara is the Tandaya or Candaya mentioned in Loarca’s “Accounts of Encomiendas”; that the name may have been originally Kan Daya, Kan Darag, or Kan Gara; that Kan Dara became Kan Gara and for phonetic convenience finally became Kalgara from which the Spaniards derived its present name CARIGARA. This is partly affirmed in the ‘Relacion de Don Miguel de Loarca’ written in 1582 which lists Carigara as the biggest, most populous and most organized town in Leyte at that period. </p>
   
   <p style="display:flex;">Carigara became the Residencia Capital, the hub of all Jesuit activities for Eastern Visayas. As political stability became established, Carigara became not only the spiritual but also the political center and premier port of Samar and Leyte. It once became a capital of Leyte when Don Pedro de Antonio took over as Alcalde Mayor in November 20, 1823, but three years later, the next Alcalde advocated returning to Tacloban, the plea was finally granted on February 26, 1830.</p> Carigara became the Residencia Capital, the hub of all Jesuit activities for Eastern Visayas.
